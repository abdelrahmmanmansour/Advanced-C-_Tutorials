## 📌 Table of Contents

🔹 Generics
🔹 Built-in Interfaces
🔹 Collections (Generic & Non-Generic)
🔹 Delegates

## 🔹 Generics

Generics allow creating type-safe, reusable, and flexible code components. They eliminate the need for repetitive code and reduce errors caused by casting and boxing/unboxing.

## 🔹 Built-in Interfaces

IComparable → Defines default sorting for objects.

IComparer → Provides custom sorting logic.

IEquatable → Defines equality between objects.

IEqualityComparer → Supports equality checks inside collections like Dictionary and HashSet.

## 🔹 Collections
✅ Generic Collections

## Type-safe and performance-oriented collections such as:
📌 List
📌 Dictionary
📌 Queue
📌 Stack
📌 HashSet

## ⚠️ Non-Generic Collections

Older, non-type-safe collections such as:
📌 ArrayList
📌 Hashtable
📌 Queue
📌 Stack

## 🔹 Delegates

Delegates are references to methods that enable flexible and dynamic programming.

## 📝 User-Defined Delegates → Custom delegates defined by developers.

⚡ Built-in Delegates →

Action → Represents a method with no return value.

Func → Represents a method with a return value.

Predicate → Represents a method that returns a boolean.
